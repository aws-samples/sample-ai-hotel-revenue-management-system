## Pricing Strategy Framework

### Rate Structure Best Practices
1. **Base Rate Establishment**
   - Set base rates at 15-20% above minimum acceptable rate
   - Adjust base rates seasonally (at least quarterly)
   - Maintain rate integrity across channels

2. **Dynamic Pricing Parameters**
   - Implement day-of-week pricing differentials (typically 20-30% weekend premium)
   - Adjust rates based on occupancy thresholds (e.g., +10% at 70% occupancy, +20% at 80%, etc.)
   - Consider length-of-stay pricing strategies for extended stays

3. **Segmentation Pricing**
   - Corporate rates: 10-15% below BAR (Best Available Rate)
   - Group rates: Variable based on size, dates, and ancillary spend
   - Loyalty program rates: 5-10% below BAR
   - Package rates: Include value-adds rather than deep discounts

4. **Promotional Strategy**
   - Limited-time offers: Maximum 20% discount with clear end dates
   - Advance purchase rates: 10-15% discount with non-refundable terms
   - Flash sales: 25-30% discount with extremely limited availability
   - Value-add promotions over direct discounting when possible

### Channel Management
1. **Direct Booking Incentives**
   - Exclusive benefits for direct bookings (room upgrades, F&B credits)
   - Member-only rates (5-10% discount)
   - Loyalty point bonuses for direct bookings

2. **OTA Strategy**
   - Maintain rate parity while controlling inventory allocation
   - Limit high-demand dates on OTAs
   - Use OTAs strategically for need periods
   - Optimize content and ranking factors on OTA platforms

3. **Metasearch Strategy**
   - Ensure direct rates appear prominently
   - Bid strategically on high-converting search terms
   - Monitor and match competitive rates when appropriate

4. **Wholesale and Opaque Channels**
   - Strict inventory controls on opaque channels
   - Wholesale rates at minimum 30% below BAR
   - Use for distressed inventory only during low season

- Cancellation tracking

### Medium-term Forecasting (31-90 days)
- Booking pace by segment
- Year-over-year comparison
- Event impact analysis
- Competitive pricing trends

### Long-term Forecasting (91+ days)

- Group booking pace

## Revenue Optimization Techniques

### Inventory Management
1. **Room Type Optimization**
   - Strategic overbooking of base room types (typically 3-5%)
   - Upgrade paths for high-value guests

2. **Length of Stay Controls**
   - Minimum stay restrictions for high-demand periods
   - Maximum stay controls for promotional rates
   - Optimizing stay patterns around shoulder dates
